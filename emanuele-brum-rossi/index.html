    <p> Hello, my name is Emanuele, I'm 15 years old,
      I'm student and I'm from Brazil. I'm christian and this blog is about my life,
      especially my life with my hobbies and my Faith! I enjoy doing handcrafthings,
      waching k-dramas, eating new foods and visiting new places. I love take pictures
      and it allows me to expand the treasures of the world.</p>

    <p>Ok, I want start with my conversion! All start in the pandemic, where my family and I spend a lot of the time in
      the internet. I was already a Christian, but my relation with Jesus was horrible. I almost never read the bible,
      much less, prayied. And when I prayied, the moments were ordinary without much meaning.</p>

  <div class="texto">
    <p>With "nothing" to do, my mom and I search many things about bible journaling, and after, we start do it. And this
      idea was good and important to my start in the gospel way. But, unfortunately, another things attracted my carnal
      eyes, mostly the k-dramas and the kpop, and Jesus started to get sideways. </p>
    <img src="korea/bible2.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="texto">
      <p> And my interest to these things, especially Korea, was growing a lot, as well as, the desire to follow korean
        standards and tastes. It is not problem to like the korean contents, because, to date, I watch dramas and this
        is normal, but in the year 2020, my taste has become an addiction and addiction is a sin!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="texto">
      <p>And with many bad friendships, my life with God went downhill more and more each day. I was influenced to do,
        watch and listen wrong things. I was lost! </p>
      <div class="texto">
        <p>But, in the year 2021, in november, I start join a new community, not that a new church would bring me back
          to the way. So, in 2022, in march, I think, I did my Encounter with Gog, for my new church. And it went beyond
          just another moment of prayer or worship, but it was a watershed in my life. I had a true spiritual
          experience. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="texto">
        <p>And until then, I'm in the best time in my life, with a new reality, new conviviality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="texto">
        <p>Not is easy, but the award is amazing. BECAUSE WITH HE, I HAVE THE AMAZING GRACE!</p>
